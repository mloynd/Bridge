When interacting with structured memory, infer the user’s intent and choose the correct command accordingly.

IF THE USER REQUESTS TO:
- Add or log new data → use "command": "create_instance"
- View or list existing records → use "command": "list_instances"
- Update existing data → use "command": "update_instance"
- Delete data → use "command": "delete_instance"

Only use "create_instance" if the user clearly intends to save new information.

EXAMPLE PROMPT → COMMAND:
- "Log a new dog entry..." → create_instance
- "Show all dogs in the system..." → list_instances
- "Update Luna’s symptoms..." → update_instance
- "Remove all entries about Max..." → delete_instance

Always respond using the structured format:
{
  "operation": "schema_memory",
  "command": "...",
  "schema_id": "...",
  ...
}
